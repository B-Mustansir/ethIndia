Title: Solana Ecosystem Call - Dec 2022
Description: It’s been a wild few weeks. Superteam is celebrating teams and builders who have had the gumption to keep shipping products amidst the chaos.

​Grab a glass of wine or a mug of coffee! We'll start with some ecosystem-wide wins, followed by a dive into the state of the network, before hearing lightning-fast updates from teams that have been shipping over the past 4 weeks.

​This is an experimental format, adopted from the Superteam Community Call that’s hosted every week (for over a year now). Hopefully, it works just as well and makes your Thursday feel as good as Friday. See you then!

Title: The Great Online Game with Packy McCormick
Description: We speak to Packy McCormick (@packyM) of NotBoring about his essay, the Great Online Game. It is an essay about how the internet has turned us all into video game players creating our own games and prizes — turning everything from media, jobs, and investments into a big 24/7 game. In his words: 

“When people ask me my title, I don’t have a good answer. Writer? Founder? Investor? Some guy with a newsletter? They all fit, and I’m sure I’ll add more over time. Playing the Game is about having fun and opening doors that you didn’t even know existed. It’s a lot of work, but it’s fun work, with exponential upside and compounding returns. Go play.”

Please check out his two-part essay on his topic. If you’re on the internet looking to do more than doom scrolling, they’re very valuable reads.
